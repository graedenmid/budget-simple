# Budget Simple - Implementation Plan

## PRD Summary

Budget Simple is a web-based personal finance management application designed to replace cumbersome spreadsheet-based budgeting with an automated, user-friendly solution. The app enables users to set up budget items as either fixed amounts or percentages of their income, automatically tracks spending per paycheck, logs one-off expenses, and provides intelligent recommendations for allocating surplus funds. Built with a modern tech stack (Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase), the application supports flexible income cadences (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, etc.) and features envelope-style budgeting with real-time tracking and historical analysis.

The primary goal is to reduce monthly budgeting setup time by 80% compared to spreadsheets while enabling users to allocate at least 20% of discretionary income to savings or debt repayment. The MVP focuses on core automation features including user authentication, income management, budget item configuration, expense tracking, and smart surplus allocation recommendations, all delivered through an intuitive mobile-responsive interface.
