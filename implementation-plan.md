# Budget Simple - Implementation Plan

## PRD Summary

Budget Simple is a web-based personal finance management application designed to replace cumbersome spreadsheet-based budgeting with an automated, user-friendly solution. The app enables users to set up budget items as either fixed amounts or percentages of their income, automatically tracks spending per paycheck, logs one-off expenses, and provides intelligent recommendations for allocating surplus funds. Built with a modern tech stack (Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase), the application supports flexible income cadences (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, etc.) and features envelope-style budgeting with real-time tracking and historical analysis.

The primary goal is to reduce monthly budgeting setup time by 80% compared to spreadsheets while enabling users to allocate at least 20% of discretionary income to savings or debt repayment. The MVP focuses on core automation features including user authentication, income management, budget item configuration, expense tracking, and smart surplus allocation recommendations, all delivered through an intuitive mobile-responsive interface.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure

**Done**: Set up development environment and foundational architecture

- [x] Establish coding standards and cursor rules
- [x] Initialize Next.js 14 project with TypeScript configuration
- [x] Install and configure Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/ui components
- [x] Set up Supabase project with PostgreSQL database
- [x] Configure Supabase authentication (email/password, social logins)
- [x] Set up Vercel deployment pipeline
- [x] Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD (linting, tests, type checks)
- [x] Create project folder structure

### Phase 2: Database Schema & Backend Setup ✅ COMPLETE

**Done**: Implement core data models and backend infrastructure

- [x] Create database schema for all core tables (users, income_sources, budget_items, pay_periods, allocations, expenses, suggestions)
- [x] Implement Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for user data isolation
- [x] Set up Supabase Edge Functions for business logic calculations

**Done**: Set up comprehensive Supabase Edge Functions for business logic  
Created four Edge Functions for core financial calculations: budget-calculations (handles allocation logic with dependency support), income-calculations (pro-rates income across different cadences), recommendation-engine (generates intelligent surplus allocation suggestions), and surplus-allocation (applies recommended allocations). Functions include proper error handling, CORS support, and structured responses for frontend integration.

- [x] Create database indexes for optimal query performance
- [x] Implement data validation and sanitization functions

**Done**: Complete database optimization and validation infrastructure  
Successfully applied comprehensive performance indexes including composite indexes for common query patterns, GIN indexes for array operations (budget dependencies), partial indexes for filtered queries, and covering indexes for query optimization. Implemented robust data validation and sanitization functions with automatic triggers for income validation, budget item constraints, pay period date validation, and expense sanitization. Added monitoring views for index usage tracking and performance analysis. All SQL migrations executed successfully in Supabase without errors.

- [x] Set up error handling and logging infrastructure

**Done**: Set up comprehensive error handling and logging infrastructure  
Created a robust error handling system with categorized error types (Auth, Database, Validation, Calculation, Permission), centralized logging with Supabase integration, React error boundary component with user-friendly fallback UI, and database operation wrapper with automatic error handling and retry logic. The system includes console logging for development, database persistence for tracking, and hooks for manual error reporting.

### Phase 3: Authentication & User Management

**Done**: Build secure user authentication and account management

- [x] Implement user registration and login flows
- [x] Create password recovery functionality
- [x] Build user profile management interface
- [x] Implement JWT-based session management
- [x] Add social login options (Google, GitHub)
- [x] Create user onboarding flow with income setup

**Done**: Comprehensive authentication and user management system completed  
Successfully implemented a complete authentication system with React Context for state management, secure user registration and login flows with form validation using react-hook-form and Zod schemas, password recovery functionality with email-based reset links, protected routing middleware for authenticated pages, and JWT-based session management through Supabase Auth. Created login, register, forgot password, and dashboard pages with consistent UI using Shadcn/ui components. Integrated comprehensive error handling and logging for all auth operations. The system automatically creates user profiles in the database upon registration and provides a smooth user experience with proper loading states and error feedback.
